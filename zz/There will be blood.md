on the surface, a story about oil. But oil is only the substance. The real subject is hunger—how it disguises itself as ambition, how it dresses in the clothes of progress, how it can hollow a person out until there’s nothing left but appetite and a kind of scorched will.

## 1) The bones of the story (what happens)

### The opening: a man and the earth

We begin with almost no dialogue. Daniel Plainview is alone in the desert at the turn of the 20th century, digging for silver. There’s something primal about it: a solitary human scraping at indifferent stone. He gets injured, badly, and still drags himself back to town. This wordless beginning matters. It tells you who he is before he ever speaks—someone fueled by endurance, pain tolerance, and obsession.

Not long after, Daniel transitions from mining to oil. Oil is the new bloodline of the modern world, and Daniel senses it before the culture fully does.

### The “family man” enters: H.W.

Daniel’s partner is killed in an accident, leaving behind an infant son. Daniel takes the baby—H.W.—and raises him. The film doesn’t sentimentalize this. It’s both tenderness and tactic. H.W. becomes Daniel’s _face_ to the world: the image of stability and trustworthiness in a time when people fear being swindled by strangers.

Daniel and H.W. travel, prospect, and negotiate land purchases. Daniel speaks to families with the cadence of a self-made prophet of modernity—promising roads, schools, prosperity. He sells a future.

### Little Boston: the Sunday family and the spark of conflict

A young man named Paul Sunday approaches Daniel with a tip: oil is seeping on his family’s land near a small town called Little Boston, California. Daniel investigates and finds the land rich.

This is where the film’s central duel begins—not with Paul, but with Paul’s twin brother, Eli Sunday, the town’s preacher and spiritual authority. Eli wants a cut of the deal for his church. Daniel wants control, clean and total.

From the start, they recognize something in each other. Not similarity exactly—more like mirrored ambition wearing different costumes. One speaks for God, one speaks for industry. Both want followers. Both want dominance.

### The well, the fire, and the loss of hearing

Daniel brings in equipment and men. The drilling begins. When the first big strike happens, it’s not a clean triumph—it becomes catastrophe. Gas erupts. A tower catches fire. The celebration turns into panic.

In the chaos, H.W. is injured and loses his hearing. It’s one of the film’s most brutal turns because it doesn’t feel like “plot.” It feels like the cost of extraction. The earth yields, but it doesn’t yield politely.

Daniel’s reaction is telling: he’s shaken, yes, but he keeps moving toward the well, toward the flame, toward the business. He is a man whose inner compass points one way.

### Separation: the son becomes collateral

As H.W.’s disability becomes undeniable, Daniel—unable or unwilling to slow down—sends him away to a school for the deaf. It’s framed as practical, even benevolent, but it lands emotionally as abandonment. The child who made Daniel look human is now inconvenient to the machine.

This is where something sharp forms: Daniel’s “fatherhood” has always been in tension with his deeper drive. The tension snaps.

### Humiliation and “religion” as a battleground

Eli and Daniel’s conflict escalates through public rituals. Eli wants Daniel to submit to spiritual authority; Daniel wants Eli reduced, exposed, made small.

A key moment comes when Daniel—needing Eli’s cooperation for a pipeline deal—agrees to be baptized in Eli’s church. But the “baptism” becomes a power performance. Eli forces Daniel into a confession-like spectacle in front of the congregation, extracting humiliation as payment.

Daniel, who has treated religion as theater, is forced to _play a role in that theater_—and he hates it. Not because he believes, but because he is being dominated.

### The false brother: intimacy as a con

A drifter arrives claiming to be Daniel’s half-brother, Henry. For a while, Daniel softens. They talk. They drink. Daniel seems—almost shockingly—less alone.

And then, slowly, suspicion takes over. Daniel discovers Henry is an imposter. The closeness was counterfeit.

Daniel kills him and buries him in the earth—an act that feels less like a crime of passion than a ritual: the psyche eliminating a threat to its control. This is the moment where you understand Daniel’s loneliness isn’t incidental. It’s curated. He would rather be alone than be vulnerable.

### The epilogue: wealth, isolation, and the final ritual

Years later, Daniel lives in a mansion, drunk, sick with himself, surrounded by the spoils of victory. The success he chased has arrived, and it has no warmth. It’s not a home; it’s a private kingdom.

H.W., now an adult, returns. He wants to build his own life and his own business—separate from Daniel. Daniel responds with cruelty, reframing the father-son bond as something transactional, even performative. H.W. leaves.

Then Eli appears—ruined, desperate, seeking money. The power roles have reversed. Now Eli must abase himself before Daniel.

Daniel makes him perform a kind of anti-baptism: a humiliating renunciation of his own spiritual identity. And then Daniel kills him, not in a frenzy, but with a cold finality. The film ends with Daniel alone, having “won,” and having annihilated the last living witness to his inner war.

## 2) Daniel and Eli: two kinds of hunger (and one shared illness)

A useful way to see the film is this: Daniel and Eli are not opposites. They are two branches of the same human impulse—what Jung might call _inflation_, the ego swollen with a sense of destiny.

- **Daniel’s religion is extraction.** He believes in the earth as something to be conquered and converted into power. He doesn’t merely want money; he wants _to win_. He confesses, at one point, to a deep dislike of people. His ambition isn’t social—it’s adversarial.
    
- **Eli’s capitalism is spiritual.** He uses faith as leverage, as a stage where he can be the center. He speaks of healing and salvation, but he also wants recognition, authority, a kind of local empire.
    

They’re both performing mastery. One through the industrial body, one through the religious voice.

And each sees the other as a threat because each exposes the other’s costume.

## 3) A Jungian reading: shadow, fatherhood, and the black substance

### Oil as the unconscious

Oil is ancient life, compressed into darkness. You could call it the underworld made profitable.

In a Jungian sense, oil resembles the **unconscious libido**—raw energy from beneath awareness. It can power a civilization, yes, but it can also intoxicate, pollute, and ignite. The film keeps pairing oil with fire, as if to say: when the underworld breaks the surface, it doesn’t ask permission.

### Daniel as the devouring father (the shadow of the “self-made man”)

Daniel is often read as the American entrepreneur turned monstrous. Jung gives a deeper language: Daniel resembles the **devouring father archetype**—the patriarch who cannot tolerate the child becoming separate.

H.W.’s adulthood threatens Daniel not financially, but symbolically. Separation is the child’s necessary move toward individuation, and Daniel experiences it as betrayal because his inner world cannot hold love without ownership.

This is shadow not in the cartoon sense of “evil,” but in the human sense: the parts of us that grow when we never learn to be held, and therefore only learn to hold _tightly_.

### Eli as the shadow of faith

Eli embodies what happens when spirituality becomes a tool for ego. Jung warned about religious symbols used to inflate the self—when the person doesn’t serve the sacred, but recruits the sacred to serve the person.

Eli isn’t “religion,” exactly. He’s what religion can become when it’s starved of humility.

### Their relationship as mutual projection

Daniel projects onto Eli everything he despises: hypocrisy, neediness, manipulation.  
Eli projects onto Daniel the figure of the worldly demon: greed, arrogance, godlessness.

But the unsettling truth is that each carries elements of the other. That’s why their conflict feels so personal. It isn’t debate; it’s psychic warfare.

## 4) Existential and cultural commentary: what the film says without preaching

### The American promise, stripped down

The film is set during a period when America is mythologizing itself: industry, expansion, “making something from nothing.”

But _There Will Be Blood_ asks: what if the myth is powered by a private wound?

Daniel’s drive reads like compensation. Not simply “he wants money,” but “he needs to never be powerless again.” This is the existential ache under many cultural projects: the attempt to outpace vulnerability through achievement.

### Progress as a kind of violence

The drilling brings roads, jobs, and infrastructure—real benefits. The film doesn’t deny that. It just refuses to romanticize the cost.

The land is bargained for. Families are persuaded. A town’s spiritual center is corrupted by rivalry. A child is permanently harmed. Men die. And the world keeps calling it development.

That’s part of the film’s quiet horror: it shows how easily a society can normalize devastation when the devastation comes packaged as prosperity.

### Masculinity without softness becomes a closed room

Nearly everything in the film is men and male authority: deals, sermons, rivalries, inheritances. Tenderness appears only in flickers, and those flickers are punished or abandoned.

Daniel’s tragedy isn’t that he is “too strong.” It’s that he is too defended. He cannot metabolize intimacy. So intimacy turns into control, and control turns into isolation, and isolation turns into something feral.

## 5) Key motifs that keep repeating (like dreams do)

- **Silence and sound:** The opening’s silence; H.W.’s deafness; Daniel’s later world of muffled human connection. It’s as if the film slowly removes the possibility of being reached.
    
- **Fire and oil:** Energy and destruction married together. The same substance that makes modern life possible also burns men alive.
    
- **Rituals of humiliation:** The “baptism,” the later forced renunciation—these are not spiritual acts but dominance acts. The film understands that humans will turn anything into hierarchy if they’re frightened enough.
    
- **Fathers and sons:** Biological, adopted, false brothers—family appears repeatedly, but rarely as refuge. More as a site of bargaining, legacy, and psychic inheritance.

## 6) What the ending leaves you with (the aftertaste)

The final image isn’t just “a man who became evil.” It’s a man who achieved his aim and found it spiritually weightless. The drive that promised satisfaction delivers only more hunger.

In Jungian terms, Daniel never integrates. He never makes peace with his shadow; he becomes possessed by it. The result is not melodramatic villainy—it’s a bleak kind of spiritual malnutrition: the richest man in the room who cannot be nourished.

And maybe that’s why the film lands so heavily for people who are tired of noise. It doesn’t try to comfort you with moral clarity. It just shows you what happens when a life is organized around conquest rather than relationship.

Not to shame ambition. Not to romanticize poverty. But to ask—softly, relentlessly—what you are buying with your winning.



---

 Daniel can’t rest inside himself. He can only rest _against_ someone.

And the tragedy is that he chooses people he can lean on without having to be truly known.

### The “leaning” isn’t love or use — it’s both, braided together

When H.W. is small, Daniel can carry him and also _carry himself through him_. The child makes him legible to the world: “family man,” “trustworthy,” “builder.” But H.W. also gives Daniel something more private—an attachment that doesn’t require negotiation. A child can’t really leave. A child can’t truly disagree. A child can’t say, “This isn’t yours.”

That’s the dangerous comfort: closeness without the risk of equality.

When H.W. loses his hearing, it’s not only an injury to the boy—it’s an injury to Daniel’s whole way of relating. Suddenly love requires patience, translation, humility, slowness. Daniel doesn’t know that language. So he does what hardened people often do when tenderness becomes complicated: he calls it “practical” and creates distance.

Sending H.W. away is framed like responsibility, but psychologically it also functions like **removing his own vulnerability from the room**. H.W. becomes a living reminder of the cost of Daniel’s hunger—and Daniel can’t bear reminders.

### Then the “brother” arrives: a safer kind of intimacy

The fake brother (Henry) is a fascinating substitution. With him, Daniel gets companionship that feels adult, symmetrical, even soothing—someone beside him who doesn’t demand softness, only recognition. A brother doesn’t require the kind of emotional labor a wounded child does. A brother can drink with you, laugh with you, affirm your story.

From a Jungian angle, Henry is almost like a _dream figure_: a temporary container for Daniel’s unmet need for kinship. He’s the **Trickster** in human form—offering warmth, but built on fraud. And Daniel, who distrusts everyone, still lets himself believe. That tells you how starving he is.

When Daniel realizes Henry is fake, the betrayal isn’t just social—it’s existential. It confirms Daniel’s deepest suspicion: _closeness is a con._ The killing, then, isn’t only about punishment. It’s like Daniel murdering the part of himself that hoped intimacy could be real.

### Bringing H.W. back: not repair, but restoration of the old spell

After Henry collapses, Daniel pulls H.W. back into his orbit. That can look like love—and part of it is. But it’s also Daniel trying to re-stabilize his inner world: “If the brother was false, at least the son is mine.” Not “mine” in the tender sense. “Mine” in the anchoring sense.

Daniel doesn’t really do _repair_—he does _replacement_. He can’t sit in guilt long enough to metabolize it. So he reaches for the nearest structure that makes him feel solid again.

### The adult son’s separation is individuation — and Daniel experiences it as treason

When H.W. grows up and wants a life of his own, it’s the most psychologically healthy thing in the story. It’s the human soul doing what it’s supposed to do: stepping out from the father’s shadow, making a separate center of gravity.

But for Daniel, separation isn’t a normal developmental step. It’s an amputation.

Because Daniel’s version of “sharing everything” isn’t mutuality—it’s **ownership disguised as provision**. He gives material security, a name, a legacy, a business education… and in his mind that means the relationship is paid in full. So when H.W. chooses his own path, Daniel reads it not as growth, but as theft.

This is the devouring-father pattern in its most painful form:

- “I built you” becomes “you belong to me.”
- “I provided” becomes “you owe me.”
- Love becomes a ledger.

### The bleak paradox the film sits inside

Daniel genuinely needs someone. You’re right. He wants to be at ease. He wants a human counterweight to his inner violence.

But he can’t tolerate the one condition that makes real closeness real: the other person is not an extension of you.

So he alternates between two moves:

1. **Attach** to feel human.
2. **Destroy** the attachment once it asserts independence.

And by the end, he hasn’t just lost his son. He’s lost the last bridge back to himself.

If you want to take it one layer deeper: H.W.’s deafness is almost symbolic. Daniel’s life becomes a long story of not being able to _hear_ another person—until finally, no one is left to speak.
