bobby's a salvage diver. he goes down to check out this sunken private jet in the gulf of mexico and finds dead people strapped in their seats. but here's the thing—there's supposed to be nine passengers according to the manifest but he only counts eight bodies. and the black box is missing. so someone either escaped or someone took stuff, and now bobby's probably gonna have problems because of it.

and yeah, he immediately has problems. the government starts following him around, his bank accounts get frozen, his stuff gets seized. people keep asking him questions he doesn't have answers to. he's basically being harassed by mysterious federal types who think he knows something about whatever happened on that plane.

bobby's also dealing with his dead sister alicia. she killed herself before the book starts and he was deeply, uh... _too_ in love with her. like not in a normal sibling way. she was a genius mathematician but also severely mentally ill, and their relationship was the kind of thing that messed both of them up. he's grieving her through the whole book and it's pretty dark.

the book jumps around in time a lot. we get bobby's current disaster life, but also flashbacks to his past, his relationship with alicia, his father who worked on the atomic bomb at oak ridge and feels guilty about it forever. there's all this generational trauma stuff about violence and guilt and science doing terrible things.

bobby used to be a race car driver but his friend died in a crash and he quit. so he's already someone who walks away from things and is haunted by death. he has friends—other divers, some random people—but mostly he seems tired and isolated and just sort of... floating through life waiting for it to end.

the government pressure keeps building. they want to know about the missing passenger and the black box. bobby genuinely doesn't know anything but that doesn't help him. he loses his boat, his home, everything. he's essentially being erased by whoever's behind this.

so he runs. goes to different places, stays with people, tries to disappear. there's a lot of him just sitting around in rooms thinking about math and physics and death and alicia. mccarthy loves throwing in conversations about theoretical physics and philosophy and the nature of reality, so bobby and other characters have these long talks about whether math is real or invented and other stuff that makes your brain hurt.

the whole book is soaked in this feeling of dread and loss. bobby can't escape his sister's memory, can't escape whatever conspiracy he stumbled into, can't escape his own depression. he's smart enough to understand how meaningless everything is which just makes it worse for him.

there's no real resolution. mccarthy doesn't do neat endings. bobby keeps running, keeps grieving, keeps existing in this liminal space where nothing gets better. the mystery of the plane doesn't get solved in any satisfying way. it's more about bobby's internal collapse than any external plot.

the book's also a companion to _Stella Maris_, which is entirely alicia's story from before she died, told through therapy transcripts. so _The Passenger_ is bobby's nightmare present, and _Stella Maris_ is alicia's nightmare past, and together they're just this brutal portrait of two brilliant, broken people who loved each other in a way that destroyed them both.

basically it's a long meditation on grief, guilt, science, incest-adjacent trauma, government conspiracies, and whether existence has any meaning. everyone's miserable, nothing gets fixed, and bobby just keeps going because stopping would require effort he doesn't have.

fun times. real uplifting stuff. classic mccarthy.


---


after alicia’s death, bobby just kind of… drifts. he’s wrecked. can’t move on. can’t connect to people. keeps running—literally and emotionally. the government stuff fades. the missing passenger mystery never really matters in the end. it’s just noise around his grief.

he loses jobs. loses money. lives on boats and couches. drinks. thinks. remembers alicia. a lot. everything loops back to her. always her.

near the end, bobby ends up alone in new orleans. older. worn down. he talks to alicia in his head. not like a hallucination exactly—more like memory and guilt fused together. she’s dead, but she’s still running his life.

the book closes with bobby basically accepting that he’s finished too. not dead yet, but spiritually done. no future plans. no redemption arc. no big reveal. just a guy who survived something he wasn’t supposed to survive and doesn’t know what to do with that.

so the ending isn’t dramatic. it’s worse.  
he lives.

alicia escapes by dying.  
bobby stays behind and carries it.
