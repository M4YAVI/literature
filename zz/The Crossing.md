**Beginning.**  

The book follows Billy Parham, a teenage boy in New Mexico around the 1930s. He lives on a ranch near the Mexican border with his parents and younger brother, Boyd. Life is quiet. Hard. Ranch work. Not much talking. Then a wolf starts killing their cattle. Everyone wants it dead. Billy tracks it down and captures it. Turns out it’s a pregnant she-wolf. Instead of killing her, Billy decides—against common sense—to take her back to Mexico where she belongs. This decision basically sets the tone for the entire book. Good intentions. Bad outcomes.

**The first crossing (the wolf).**  
Billy takes the wolf south across the border. The journey is long, cold, and rough. Along the way, Billy meets strangers who tell him stories about fate, God, suffering, and how the world doesn’t care. These talks happen a lot in this book. The wolf keeps getting hurt. People try to take her. Billy keeps going anyway. Eventually, when he finally releases her in the mountains of Mexico, she’s shot and killed by locals almost immediately. Billy tries to save her. Fails. He buries her. Walks away wrecked. Lesson learned? Not really. He goes home.

**Everything falls apart at home.**  
While Billy was gone, things didn’t go well. His parents were murdered by thieves. The ranch is gone. Boyd is traumatized and angry. Billy is now basically the adult, even though he’s still a kid. Boyd becomes obsessed with finding the stolen horses and getting revenge. Billy doesn’t want this, but Boyd isn’t listening. They head to Mexico together. This is the second crossing.

**The second crossing (Boyd).**  
The brothers track the thieves into Mexico. It’s brutal. They fight, kill men, and recover the horses. Boyd gets seriously wounded. A Mexican family helps them. Boyd falls in love with a girl there and decides to stay behind. Billy leaves, promising to return. This is a bad sign. It always is.

**Loss on top of loss.**  
Billy comes back later, but Boyd is gone. Dead. Killed in violence tied to the same cycle Billy keeps walking into. Billy spends a long time wandering Mexico, trying to find Boyd’s bones. He eventually does. He carries them back north. The journey is lonely and bleak. More strangers. More long talks about death, meaning, and how nothing really adds up.

---

**The end.**  
Billy returns to the U.S. with Boyd’s remains. He tries to settle somewhere. Doesn’t work. He’s restless. Broke. Disconnected from everyone. The world has moved on. He hasn’t. In the final scene, he’s older, wandering, and basically left with nothing but memories and grief. No big redemption. No reward. Just survival.

---

**What it’s about (short version).**  
It’s about crossing lines—borders, moral lines, emotional ones. It’s about trying to do the right thing in a world that doesn’t care. Nature doesn’t care. People don’t care. History doesn’t care. Billy keeps going anyway. That’s it. That’s the book. Exhausting on purpose.

Yeah. That’s _The Crossing_. Not a fun time. But it sticks with you. Unfortunately.

Good intentions don’t save you. Bad things happen, and you just keep going.
