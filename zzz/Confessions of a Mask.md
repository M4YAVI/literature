Alright, so this kid's born in 1925 Tokyo. His name's Kochan, though nobody calls him that. His grandmother basically kidnaps him from his parents when he's a baby because she's controlling and weird. She keeps him locked up in her dark sick room for years, won't let him play with boys, only lets him hang out with girls and their dolls. Real healthy childhood stuff.

He's constantly sick as a kid. Like, always dying or about to die. His family treats him like he's made of glass. Finally when he's twelve, his parents get him back from grandma, but the damage is pretty much done.

So here's where it gets complicated. Kid realizes pretty early he's not into what he's supposed to be into. He sees this picture of Saint Sebastian - you know, the guy tied to a tree getting shot with arrows - and has his first sexual awakening at like, twelve. Yeah. That's not great. He's also obsessed with death, blood, and suffering in ways that definitely aren't normal.

He goes to this elite boys' school. Becomes obsessed with this older student, Omi. Total masculine ideal type - does kendo, has muscles, smells like sweat. Kochan fantasizes about him dying violently. Because of course he does. Never actually talks to the guy, just watches him from afar like a creep until Omi graduates.

Meanwhile, he's realizing he's gay but it's 1940s Japan so that's not exactly an option. He tries looking at pictures of women. Nothing. Pictures of men? Everything. But he starts building this whole elaborate mask persona where he pretends to be normal. Practices liking girls in the mirror. Makes up crushes. The whole performance.

World War II is happening. He's in university now, studying law because why not. All his classmates are getting drafted and dying. He keeps failing his physical exams because he's still sickly, which saves his life but also makes him feel like a coward. Classic survivor's guilt situation.

He meets Sonoko through his sister. She's pretty, innocent, comes from a good family. Perfect wife material. He decides he's going to make himself love her because that's what normal people do. They start this whole courtship where he's basically method acting being in love. Holds her hand, writes her letters, the whole thing. She actually falls for him.

Problem is, he can't... perform. They'll be alone together and he literally cannot make himself want her physically. He tries so hard it's painful to read. Imagines her as a man, imagines violent scenarios, nothing works. She's starting to notice something's off.

The war's getting worse. Tokyo's getting bombed. His family evacuates to the countryside. He's working in some airplane factory, still failing physicals, still not getting drafted. Everyone around him is dying or dead. He's having constant fantasies about dying gloriously in battle, partly because he wants to die and partly because it would prove he's a real man.

War ends. He didn't die. Disappointing. He's working at some government ministry now, still seeing Sonoko. Her family wants them to get married. She wants to get married. He's having complete mental breakdowns about it because he knows he can't be a real husband but also can't tell anyone why.

Finally grows enough of a conscience to break up with her. Tells her some vague excuse about not being good enough for her. She's devastated but accepts it. Gets engaged to someone else pretty quickly because that's what people do.

Few years pass. He's full-on given up on trying to be normal. Goes to gay bars and cruising spots but can't fully commit to that either. He's stuck between two worlds - can't be straight, can't fully accept being gay. The mask is permanent now.

Runs into Sonoko again. She's married, seems happy. They have coffee. There's this moment where they're at a dance hall and he sees this shirtless young guy and just stares at him, completely forgetting Sonoko exists. She notices. She definitely knows now, even if she doesn't say it.

Book ends with them saying goodbye. He's alone, still wearing his mask, probably will forever. He's accepted that's just how it's going to be. No dramatic revelation, no liberation, just... this is life now.

The whole thing's him narrating this to you, by the way. Like he's confessing to a priest or therapist except it's you, the reader. Every sick thought, every failed attempt at normalcy, every moment of self-loathing. He's incredibly honest
