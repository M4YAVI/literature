The story is about **Laozi**.  
Old philosopher. Daoism guy. Already legendary.  
Everyone talks about him. No one really understands him.

At the start, Laozi is old and tired.  
Really tired.  
He’s done with society, politics, teaching, all of it.  
Kings are corrupt. Scholars argue too much. Everyone misses the point.

So he decides to leave civilization entirely.  
No announcement. No speech.  
He just rides west on an ox. Quiet exit.

As he approaches the border, there’s a gate.  
The **Hangu Pass**.  
The gatekeeper is named **Yin Xi**.

Yin Xi recognizes Laozi immediately.  
Not because Laozi looks impressive.  
Because Yin Xi has been waiting for him.  
He believes a true sage would pass through one day.

Yin Xi stops Laozi and bows.  
He begs him not to leave without writing down his teachings.  
He says the world will lose everything if Laozi disappears silently.

Laozi doesn’t want to.  
He thinks words are useless.  
Teachings get twisted.  
People cling to phrases and miss reality.

But Yin Xi insists.  
He’s calm. Respectful. Persistent.  
He believes even imperfect words are better than nothing.

Laozi agrees, reluctantly.  
Not because he believes in it.  
Because refusing feels pointless.

They stay at the gate.  
Laozi writes. Slowly.  
Short lines. Vague ideas. Contradictions on purpose.

He writes about the Dao.  
That it can’t be named.  
That weakness beats strength.  
That doing nothing is often better than doing something.  
That rulers should interfere less, not more.

Yin Xi reads carefully.  
He doesn’t interrupt.  
He doesn’t argue.  
He treats every line like it matters.

While writing, Laozi reflects on himself.  
He knows people will misunderstand the text.  
They’ll quote it. Worship it. Build systems around it.  
Exactly what he hates.

But he also accepts that this is unavoidable.  
Once words exist, they stop belonging to the writer.

When he finishes, Laozi gives the text to Yin Xi.  
This text becomes the **Dao De Jing**.  
But the story doesn’t glorify that moment.

Laozi doesn’t feel accomplished.  
He feels done.

Yin Xi bows again and thanks him.  
He promises to guard the text carefully.  
To pass it on only to those who are worthy.

Laozi doesn’t comment.  
He knows Yin Xi will fail at that.  
Everyone does.

Laozi leaves the gate.  
Rides west.  
Out of history.

The story doesn’t follow him anymore.  
Because that’s the point.

The final focus is on Yin Xi.

He stays behind with the text.  
He’s proud.  
He thinks he has preserved truth.

But there’s a quiet doubt.

He realizes that what he has isn’t the master.  
Just words.  
Hints. Shadows.

The real Laozi is gone.  
The living wisdom is gone.  
All that’s left is something people will argue over forever.

The story ends there.  
No lesson spelled out.  
Just the idea that once a master becomes a book, something important is already lost.

That’s the whole thing.  
Short. Dry.  
Kind of depressing.  
Very intentional.
