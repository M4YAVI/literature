The story starts in Han Dynasty China. Emperor Wu is in charge. Very powerful. Very proud. Loves war. Loves loyalty even more.

Li Ling is a real historical general. He’s from a famous military family. His grandfather was a legend. Expectations are high. No pressure. Except all of it.

Li Ling is loyal to the Han. He believes in honor, duty, and doing the right thing. He’s also not stupid. He knows the court politics are nasty. Still goes along with it.

The Han are fighting the Xiongnu, northern nomads. Long war. Expensive. Bloody. Emperor Wu wants results. Quickly. As usual.

Li Ling is ordered to lead a campaign deep into enemy territory. The problem: he gets only about 5,000 infantry. No cavalry. The enemy has tens of thousands of mounted soldiers. Bad math. Everyone knows it.

Li Ling knows this is basically a suicide mission. He still accepts. Because loyalty. And because refusing would ruin his family.

Before leaving, he asks for reinforcements. The court ignores him. Another general, Li Guangli, gets more troops instead. Politics. Nepotism. Same old.

Li Ling marches north anyway. At first, he does well. His troops fight hard. They’re disciplined. They hold off much larger enemy forces using formations and crossbows. For a while, it’s impressive.

But it can’t last.

They run out of arrows. They’re surrounded. No reinforcements. No supplies. Retreat is impossible.

Li Ling keeps fighting. His soldiers are dying. He’s wounded. Almost everyone is dead. At the end, only a few hundred are left.

At this point, surrender is the only option. If he keeps fighting, everyone dies for nothing.

So Li Ling surrenders to the Xiongnu.

This is the turning point. In Han culture, surrender is the worst sin. Worse than death. Especially for a general from a famous family.

Back in the Han court, news arrives. Emperor Wu explodes. He calls Li Ling a traitor. No investigation. No nuance. Just rage.

Officials pile on. Nobody wants to defend Li Ling. Saying anything good would look suspicious. Career suicide.

One man speaks up: Sima Qian, the historian. He argues that Li Ling had no choice. That he fought bravely. That surrender saved lives. That calling him a traitor is unfair.

Emperor Wu does not appreciate this.

Instead of listening, he accuses Sima Qian of insulting the throne. Sima Qian is sentenced to death or castration. He chooses castration to finish his historical work. His life is basically ruined.

Meanwhile, Li Ling is alive in enemy territory. And he hears what happened.

He learns that the Han declared him a traitor. That his entire family was executed. Everyone. No exceptions.

This is where the story really sinks in.

Li Ling didn’t betray the Han. But the Han betrayed him first. Still, he’s now completely cut off. No family. No home. No way back.

The Xiongnu treat him well. They respect strength. They give him rank. Eventually, they even give him a wife.

Li Ling lives, but it’s not really living. He’s constantly torn apart inside. He hates himself for surviving. He hates the Han for killing his family. He hates the Xiongnu for being his only option.

He exists in this gray zone. Not loyal. Not disloyal. Just stuck.

Years pass.

Another Han envoy is sent north. Someone Li Ling knew. They meet.

The envoy tries to convince Li Ling to return. Says the emperor might forgive him. Says things have changed. It’s all very vague. Very political.

Li Ling doesn’t buy it. And honestly, he can’t return even if he wanted to. There’s nothing left to return to.

He explains his position calmly. No dramatics. He says he stayed alive because he had no choice. He says loyalty didn’t save his family. He says dying wouldn’t have made things better.

The envoy leaves. Nothing changes.

The story ends with Li Ling still alive among the Xiongnu. Still breathing. Still thinking. Still suffering.

No redemption arc. No heroic death. No forgiveness.

Just a man who did everything right and still lost everything.

Nakajima’s point is pretty clear. Loyalty is fragile. States demand absolute devotion but abandon people easily. History judges from a distance and doesn’t care about circumstances.

Also, survival can be worse than death. Which is cheerful.

That’s “Li Ling.”  
Everyone fails him. He lives anyway.  
End.
