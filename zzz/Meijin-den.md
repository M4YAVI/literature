**Meijin-den (The Master)** by Atsushi Nakajima.

The story is set in ancient China. Warring States period vibes. Philosophers everywhere. Everyone arguing about skill and meaning. Very on brand.

### Beginning

There’s a famous archer named **Ji Chang**. He wants to become a true master. Not just good. Not “wins contests.” The real deal. So he goes to train under a legendary teacher named **Fei Wei**.

Fei Wei is known as an absolute authority on archery. People treat him like a final boss.

Ji Chang shows up and asks to be taught. Fei Wei doesn’t say yes right away. He gives Ji Chang a task.

Not archery.

He tells Ji Chang to go home and **learn not to blink**.

That’s it.

### First Training: Not Blinking

Ji Chang leaves, confused but obedient. He ties a tiny object—sometimes described as a spinning spindle or small weight—near his eye and stares at it every day. His wife weaves nearby. The object moves constantly.

At first, he blinks like a normal human. Eventually, he stops blinking entirely. His eyes don’t flinch. Dust, wind, motion—nothing.

Years pass. This is important. It’s not weeks. It’s **years**.

Eventually, Ji Chang can stare without blinking at all.

He goes back to Fei Wei.

Fei Wei says, basically:  
“Okay. That’s step one. You still know nothing.”

### Second Training: Seeing Small Things as Big

Fei Wei gives him another task.

He tells Ji Chang to train his vision so that **tiny things appear large**.

Again, no bow. No arrows.

Ji Chang goes home again. He stares at tiny objects every day—bugs, threads, grains of sand. Over time, those things start to look bigger to him. Eventually, something tiny can fill his entire field of vision.

Years pass. Again.

He returns to Fei Wei.

Fei Wei says:  
“Better. Still not enough.”

### Third Training: Archery, Finally

Now Fei Wei finally teaches him archery.

Ji Chang learns absurdly fast. Because at this point, his eyes don’t blink, don’t shake, and can perceive detail perfectly. Shooting becomes almost trivial.

He surpasses normal archers. Then excellent ones. Then nearly everyone.

Fei Wei watches this calmly. No praise. No concern.

Eventually, Ji Chang reaches a level where he believes he’s mastered archery.

This is where things get tense.

### The Confrontation

Ji Chang and Fei Wei face each other. Teacher and student. Both with bows.

They shoot arrows at each other.

Every arrow Ji Chang fires is knocked down by Fei Wei’s arrows. Every arrow Fei Wei fires is knocked down by Ji Chang’s arrows.

Perfect balance.

Then Fei Wei shoots an arrow without a tip. Ji Chang responds the same way. Still equal.

Finally, both shoot **without arrows**, using pure technique and intent.

At this point, it’s no longer about weapons. It’s symbolic. Skill has gone past the physical.

Ji Chang realizes something.

Fei Wei isn’t trying to win. He’s testing whether Ji Chang understands what mastery actually is.

### Realization

Ji Chang suddenly understands that true mastery is **not about defeating others**, or even about archery itself.

It’s about reaching a state where technique disappears. Where intention, body, and action are one. Where you no longer think about skill.

Once he realizes this, the conflict ends.

No dramatic victory. No killing. Just understanding.

Fei Wei then tells him, "Look, I can't teach you anything else. Go see this old guy named Gan Ying on Mount Tai. He’s the real deal."

Ji Chang climbs the mountain. It takes forever. He finds Gan Ying, who is basically a hundred years old and looks wild. Ji Chang tries to show off his shooting. Gan Ying laughs at him. He says shooting with a bow is for amateurs. The real master shoots without shooting.

Gan Ying takes him to a cliff edge. He imagines a bow, imagines an arrow, and shoots down a bird with sheer mental pressure. Ji Chang is terrified. He stays with the old man for nine years.

When Ji Chang finally comes back down the mountain, he looks different. He looks like a wooden doll. No expression. No ego. He’s totally empty. He doesn't show off anymore. In fact, he never touches a bow again.

People ask him to shoot. He refuses. He says the ultimate stage of activity is inactivity. Or something deep like that. He lives the rest of his life doing absolutely nothing. He’s considered the greatest archer ever, even though he just sits there.

At the very end, he’s an old man. He visits a friend’s house and sees a bow leaning against the wall. He stares at it. He asks, "What is this tool? What do you use it for?"

Everyone is shocked. He had mastered archery so hard that he forgot what a bow was. The painter threw away his brushes, the musician cut his strings, and the carpenter was too scared to use his ruler. Everyone was afraid to do anything because this guy forgot everything.

That’s it. He died peacefully. Smoke comes out of the chimney. The end.

### Core Idea (since it matters)

The story isn’t really about archery.

It’s about:

- Mastery taking time. A lot of it.
- Foundations being invisible and boring.
- Skill becoming meaningless once it’s complete.
- The idea that the highest level of anything looks like **nothing**.

Very Taoist. Very quiet. Very unsatisfying if you want action. Completely intentional.

That’s the whole thing.  
No twists. No redemption arc. Just patience, discipline, and the slow realization that the goal dissolves when you reach it.

Kind of exhausting.  
On purpose.
