There's this poet named Du Fu. Real historical figure, actually. One of China's greatest poets from the Tang Dynasty. The story's set when he's old and sick, wandering around China because of all the political chaos. An Lushan Rebellion and all that. Fun times.

Du Fu's staying with his family on a boat. They're basically refugees floating down rivers trying to survive. He's sick, probably dying, knows it. Still writing poetry because what else is he gonna do.

One night there's this perfect moon. Du Fu goes out on deck to look at it. Starts thinking about his whole life. How he wanted to serve his country but everything went to hell. How he wrote all this amazing poetry but barely anyone noticed while he was alive. Classic artist problems.

He remembers his friend Li Bai. Another famous poet. Total opposite of Du Fu - wild, drunk all the time, didn't care about rules or government service. They had this complicated friendship where Du Fu admired him but also thought he was irresponsible. Li Bai probably didn't think about Du Fu nearly as much. Awkward.

The moon makes him think about all the poems he wrote about moons. There were a lot. Moons and suffering, that was his whole thing. He thinks about how Li Bai supposedly died trying to catch the moon's reflection in water while drunk on a boat. Probably not true but poetic, so whatever.

Du Fu starts composing one last poem in his head. About the moon, obviously. About how beauty continues even when everything's falling apart. About how art outlasts the artist. Deep stuff while you're dying on a boat.

He's getting weaker. Can barely stand. His family's inside, doesn't know he's out there dying. He's looking at this moon and thinking about how his poems will outlive him. How maybe someday people will read them and understand what he was trying to say about suffering and beauty and duty.

Then he remembers being young. Having ambitions. Thinking he'd save the empire with his wisdom and poetry. Hilarious in retrospect. The empire fell apart anyway. He never got the recognition he wanted. Spent his last years running from war and starving.

But here's the thing - he's not bitter like Li Ling from the tiger story. He's sad but accepting. Like, yeah, life sucked, but at least he wrote the poems. At least he tried to capture something true about human suffering.

The moon's really bright. Almost supernatural. Du Fu feels like he's dissolving into the moonlight. Very poetic way to die. He thinks about how the moon watched everything - all the dynasties rising and falling, all the poets writing about it, all the wars and peace. The moon doesn't care. It just keeps shining.

His last thought is that maybe his poems are like the moon. They'll keep existing after he's gone, shining their little light on human suffering. Someone might read them centuries later and get it.

Then he dies. Right there on the boat deck. Under the moon.

His family finds him in the morning. The story implies they bury him by the river. Nobody important notices. Just another old refugee dying during wartime.

But here's Nakajima's point - we're reading about Du Fu now, right? His poems did survive. He did become one of China's greatest poets. Just took about a thousand years for people to fully appreciate him. So maybe he was right about the moon thing.

The whole story's about how artists suffer and die unrecognized but their work might matter later. About how beauty and suffering are connected. About how the moon keeps shining whether you're a famous poet or dying nobody.

Nakajima wrote this while Japan was deep in World War II. Probably knew he was dying of tuberculosis. So writing about a poet dying unrecognized while creating immortal art - yeah, not exactly subtle what he was thinking about.

That's "Sangetsuki." Old poet dies looking at the moon while thinking about art and mortality. The end. Real uplifting stuff.
