“The Old Fisherman.” Short story. Not long. Still heavy. As usual.

The story is set in ancient China. Vague dynasty. Doesn’t really matter. Everything important is internal anyway.

There’s an old fisherman. No name. He lives alone by a river. He fishes every day. Same routine. Quiet life. No ambition. No drama. He’s fine with that.

He’s old. Very old. His body is weak. His hands shake. Fishing hurts now. But he keeps doing it because that’s all he’s ever done. Also because stopping would mean thinking. He avoids that.

He barely talks to people. He doesn’t care about society, politics, or success. He just exists. Eats little. Sleeps little. Fishes a lot.

One day, a young man shows up. A scholar-type. Educated. Ambitious. Clearly from the city. He’s traveling and stops by the river.

The scholar notices the fisherman and starts talking to him. He’s curious. Maybe bored. Maybe trying to sound wise.

He asks the fisherman why he lives like this. Why not seek office. Why not use wisdom to serve the state. Typical Confucian questions. Very earnest. Very annoying.

The fisherman listens. Says almost nothing. When he does speak, it’s short and plain. He doesn’t argue. He doesn’t preach. He just answers honestly.

He says he fishes because that’s his place. He says chasing rank and fame leads to suffering. He says the state uses people and throws them away. He’s seen it happen. He doesn’t want that life.

The scholar pushes back. Says serving the ruler is a duty. Says talent shouldn’t be wasted. Says withdrawal is selfish.

The fisherman doesn’t get offended. He just calmly points out that rulers change, laws change, and loyalty doesn’t protect anyone. He says he chose survival over ideals. Not heroism. Just peace.

Then the fisherman tells his past. This is important.

He wasn’t always a fisherman. Long ago, he was educated. He served in government. Low rank, but enough to see how things worked.

He watched good people get promoted, then destroyed. He watched corrupt people survive. He watched rulers reward loyalty one day and punish it the next.

Eventually, he was accused of something minor. Barely mattered. But the punishment was severe. Career over. Reputation ruined.

He wasn’t executed. Which is almost worse. He was just discarded.

So he left. He went to the river. He became a fisherman. Slowly. On purpose.

He says fishing is simple. You wait. You fail. You succeed sometimes. The river doesn’t judge you. It doesn’t demand loyalty. It doesn’t care if you’re talented.

The scholar listens. He’s uncomfortable now. This wasn’t the lecture he wanted.

The fisherman then warns him. Says ambition eats people alive. Says the state doesn’t love anyone. Says being useful is dangerous.

The scholar asks if the fisherman regrets leaving. Giving up influence. Giving up meaning.

The fisherman pauses. Long pause.

He says no. He says hunger is easier than fear. He says obscurity is safer than recognition. He says peace is worth more than legacy.

The scholar has nothing to say after that. He realizes there’s no argument here. Just experience.

Eventually, the scholar leaves. Still young. Still ambitious. Still unconvinced. But shaken.

The fisherman goes back to fishing. Same river. Same net. Same silence.

The story ends there. No twist. No lesson spelled out. Just contrast.

Nakajima’s point is quiet but sharp.  
Withdrawal isn’t weakness.  
Society punishes talent as often as it rewards it.  
And choosing to live small can be the most rational decision available.

The fisherman survives.  
The scholar will probably suffer later.  
History won’t remember either.

That’s it.
