So. Lieutenant Schmidt. Russian officer. Artillery guy. Late 30s. Balding. Thin. Kind of looks like a disappointed accountant. Works in a military office in Siberia during World War I. Not on the front. Back home. Paperwork. Boring. He’s got a wife. She’s dead. Died in childbirth. Kid survived. He doesn’t like the kid. Feels guilty about not liking the kid. But mostly just doesn’t care. The kid’s with relatives somewhere. He doesn’t visit.

He’s not sad. Not angry. Just… numb. Like he’s been slowly fading out for years. His life is routine. Wake up. Uniform. Office. Stare at papers. Eat bad soup. Go home. Sleep. Repeat. His coworkers don’t like him. He doesn’t like them. They think he’s cold. He thinks they’re idiots. He corrects grammar in reports like it matters. Nobody listens.

One day, a new guy shows up. Young. Energetic. Idealistic. Thinks the war is noble. Schmidt hates him immediately. Not violently. Just… deeply. The guy starts asking questions. About Schmidt’s past. About his wife. About why he’s so quiet. Schmidt gives one-word answers. The guy doesn’t get the hint. Keeps poking.

Meanwhile, Schmidt starts having these weird moments. Like, he’ll be writing a report and suddenly remember the smell of his wife’s hair. Or the way the light looked the day she died. Not emotional. Just… there. Like a glitch. He doesn’t cry. Doesn’t pause. Just keeps writing. But the memories stick. More of them come. Uninvited.

He starts noticing things. The way snow falls outside the window. How a horse coughs in the courtyard. The sound of a spoon clinking in a bowl. Small stuff. Stuff he hasn’t noticed in years. It’s not joyful. It’s just… real. Too real. Like the world turned up the brightness without asking.

He tries to ignore it. Focus on work. But the memories keep coming. His wife’s laugh. Her hands. The way she looked at him before she got sick. He starts to feel something. Not happiness. Not grief. Something in between. Like a dull ache behind the eyes.

Then—big twist—he gets transferred. Orders come down. He’s being sent to the front. Not combat. Still paperwork. But now with a field unit. Closer to the war. He doesn’t argue. Doesn’t complain. Just packs his things. Same gray coat. Same hat. Same face.

On the train, he sits. Stares out the window. Snow. Trees. Small towns. The young officer from the office is on the same train. Tries to talk to him. Schmidt ignores him. The guy gives up. Falls asleep. Schmidt watches him. Thinks, “He still believes in something.” Doesn’t say it.

Arrives at the front. Muddy camp. Tents. Horses. Noise. Smell of smoke and wet wool. He’s assigned a tent. Meets the other officers. They’re tired. Cynical. Jaded. They drink. Curse the war. Curse the generals. Curse the cold. Schmidt fits right in. Says almost nothing. They don’t care.

He does his job. Files reports. Signs papers. Checks supply lists. Same as before. But now there’s shells exploding in the distance. Now there’s wounded coming in. Now there’s death nearby. Not abstract. Real. Close.

One night, he can’t sleep. Walks outside. Stands in the dark. Listens. Wind. Distant gunfire. A dog barking. He looks up. Stars. Clear sky. Cold. He thinks about his wife. Thinks about the kid. Thinks about the young officer. Thinks about nothing.

And then—finally—it hits him. Not a revelation. Not a breakdown. Just a quiet, total understanding: he’s been asleep his whole life. Not dead. Not alive. Just… waiting. Going through motions. Pretending he was living. But he wasn’t. He was just… enduring.

And now, for the first time, he’s awake. And it sucks. Because being awake means feeling everything. The cold. The loneliness. The waste. The pointlessness. The fact that his wife is gone. That he never loved her enough when she was alive. That he’ll probably die out here for no reason. That nothing will change.

But also—small thing—he notices the stars are beautiful. Actually beautiful. Not poetic. Just… true. He sees them. Really sees them. For the first time.

He goes back to the tent. Lies down. Doesn’t sleep. Waits for morning.

Next day, same routine. Papers. Reports. Orders. He does it. But now he’s aware. Present. Not numb. Not happy. Just… there. Fully there.

The war keeps going. Nothing changes. Everything changes.

That’s it.

No big climax. No heroic death. No redemption arc. No last-minute confession. No dramatic reunion. He doesn’t find peace. Doesn’t find meaning. Doesn’t suddenly become a better man.

He just… wakes up. Too late. Too quietly. And then keeps going.

End.

That’s _Lieutenant Schmidt_.

Pasternak didn’t write much else like it. Short story. Almost no dialogue. Mostly internal. Quiet. Heavy. Like a sigh you feel in your bones.

It’s not about war. It’s about being asleep. And waking up. Just a little. Just enough to know you were missing everything.

And then having to live with that.

Yeah. That’s the story.
