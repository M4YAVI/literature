The story is about **Zilu**.  
He’s a rough, loud guy. Not a scholar.  
A thug, basically.  
He wears a rooster feather in his hat and carries a sword that looks like he actually uses it.

He hears about this guy **Confucius**.  
People say Confucius is a wise sage.  
Zilu thinks wise sages are annoying.  
So he goes to Confucius’s place to intimidate him. Maybe rough him up.

He walks in, acting tough.  
Confucius doesn’t flinch.  
He just talks to Zilu. Calmly.  
He asks Zilu what he’s good at.  
Zilu brags.  
Confucius dismantles his logic without even standing up.  
He points out that learning makes you better, even if you're strong.  
"A bamboo arrow is sharp, but add a metal tip and it goes deeper." That kind of thing.

Zilu is stunned.  
He’s never been talked to like that.  
He realizes he’s been an idiot.  
He bows.  
He asks to be a student.

So, the thug becomes a disciple.  
It’s a weird fit.  
Zilu is older than the other students.  
He’s impatient. He hates reading. He hates poetry.  
He just wants to _do_ things.  
If someone insults the Master, Zilu wants to punch them.  
Confucius has to keep telling him to calm down.

They spend years traveling.  
It’s not a fun road trip.  
They get exiled. They get ignored by kings. They run out of food.  
There’s a part where they are surrounded by soldiers in the wilderness.  
Everyone is starving and scared.  
Confucius is just playing his lute, totally chill.  
Zilu gets mad.  
He asks, “Does a gentleman have to suffer like this?”  
Confucius says, “Yes. The difference is the small man falls apart. The gentleman holds it together.”  
Zilu grumbles but accepts it.

He’s jealous of **Yan Hui**.  
Yan Hui is the perfect student. Smart. Quiet. Gets everything right.  
Confucius loves Yan Hui.  
Zilu knows he’ll never be the favorite.  
He’s the “usefulness” guy. The bodyguard. The one who fixes the wagon.  
But he stays loyal.  
He loves Confucius more than anyone, even if he doesn't understand half of what the man says.

Eventually, Zilu gets a job.  
He becomes a magistrate in the state of **Wei**.  
He works for the **Kong** family.  
It’s a decent gig. He tries to apply what he learned.  
Be honest. Be brave. Don't cheat people.

Then, politics happen.  
A mess in the Wei court.  
The ruler’s son, **Prince Kuaikui**, wants to take power by force.  
He launches a coup against his own son (the current Duke) and the Kong family.  
It’s chaos.

Zilu is outside the city when it starts.  
People tell him, “Don’t go back in. It’s over. The rebels won.”  
A smart person would walk away.  
Zilu isn’t a smart person.  
He’s a “gentleman” now. Or he thinks he is.  
He says, “I took their salary. I can’t run when they’re in trouble.”

He walks right back into the city.  
He goes straight to the palace.  
He finds the rebels trying to burn things down.  
He yells at them.  
He tries to save his lord.

He fights.  
He’s old now, but he’s still strong.  
But he’s outnumbered.  
Two enemy warriors attack him.  
They strike him with halberds.  
They cut the strap of his cap.  
His hat starts to fall off.

This is the moment.  
Zilu stops fighting.  
He remembers a lesson.  
“A gentleman does not die with his hat awry.”  
Priorities.

He drops his weapon.  
He reaches up to tie the string of his hat.  
He wants to look dignified. Correct.  
While he’s tying the knot, the enemies chop him to pieces.  
Literally. Minced meat.

He dies.

News travels back to Confucius.  
Confucius is old. Yan Hui is already dead.  
When he hears how Zilu died, he breaks.  
He cries.  
He tells his servants to throw away all the pickled meat in the house.  
He can’t look at it.  
It reminds him of what they did to Zilu.

And that’s it.  
The rough guy tried to be perfect.  
He died for a rule about a hat.  
The Master is left alone.
