So there's this guy Li Ling. Chinese poet from the Tang Dynasty. Really talented, passes the imperial examinations young, everyone thinks he's going places. But he's got this thing where he's too proud to take some minor government position. Wants to be recognized for his genius immediately. Typical artist ego stuff.

He waits around for the perfect job that never comes. Gets older, gets bitter. Finally swallows his pride and takes some crappy provincial post because he needs money. But now he's angry about it. Feels like the world owes him something.

One night he's traveling through the mountains for his job. Stops at an inn. Middle of the night, he goes outside and starts ranting at the moon about how unfair his life is. How nobody recognizes his talent. How he's better than everyone but stuck in this nothing position. Real fun guy at parties, I'm sure.

Then this tiger shows up. But plot twist - the tiger starts talking. In poetry. Because of course it does.

Turns out the tiger is Yuan Can, this other failed scholar. They knew each other back in the day. Yuan explains how he turned into a tiger. See, he was like Li Ling - proud, bitter, thought he was too good for everyone. His anger and resentment literally transformed him into a beast. That's the metaphor hitting you over the head right there.

Yuan tells his whole sad story. How he was obsessed with being the best poet. How he couldn't handle criticism. How he pushed everyone away. How one day he just... became a tiger. Now he has to eat people to survive but still has his human consciousness. So that's fun. Eternal suffering because you were too proud.

Li Ling's freaking out because he recognizes himself in everything Yuan's saying. Same pride, same bitterness, same trajectory. Yuan's basically showing him his future if he keeps going down this path.

Yuan asks Li Ling to tell his family what happened to him. Gives him some poems he wrote as a tiger. They're actually really good, which is extra tragic. All that talent, wasted because he couldn't get over himself.

Then Yuan runs off into the forest. Has to go eat someone because that's what tigers do. Li Ling's left standing there having an existential crisis.

The story ends with Li Ling continuing on his journey, but now he knows what happens when you let pride and resentment consume you. You literally become a monster. Subtle.

The whole thing's basically about how artistic ego and bitterness can destroy you. How wanting recognition too badly can turn you into something inhuman. How pride comes before becoming a literal maneating tiger, apparently.

Nakajima wrote this in 1942, by the way. Died the same year at thirty-three. Tuberculosis. Was a teacher and translator, wrote maybe seventeen short stories total. This is probably his most famous one. Based it on some old Chinese legend but made it all psychological and modern.

That's it. That's the story. Guy meets tiger who used to be a guy just like him, realizes he needs to check himself before he wrecks himself. Or becomes a tiger. Whatever.
